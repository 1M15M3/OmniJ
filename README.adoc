Bitcoin Unit Testing

== Regression Test Mode

Bitcoin 0.9 and later include support for Regression Test Mode (aka Regtest mode). RegTest mode creates a single node Bitcoin "network" that can confirm blocks upon command.

For example the following command will generate 101 blocks

    ./bitcoin-cli -regtest setgenerate true 101

And yes, you get the newly mined coins. They can't be spent anywhere, but they're great for testing.

The best documentation of RegTest mode that I've seen so far is https://bitcoinj.github.io/testing[How to test applications] on the new https://bitcoinj.github.io[Bitcoinj website].

== Simple Demo of RegTest mode with Bash Scripts

These are some really rough Bash scripts that can drive bitcoind in RegTest mode.

Procedure::
* Make sure Bitcoin Core 0.9 or later is installed and in your path.
* Run the server script

    ./server.sh &

* Run the client setup script to mine some coins to get started:

    ./setup-client.sh

* Run the client script (repeat as desired)

    ./client.sh

* A directory named +regtest-datadir+ is created in the current directory.
