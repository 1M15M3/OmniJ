OmniLayer for Java: Omni Transaction support, Bitcoin Core and Omni Core RPC clients, CLI utilities, and integration tests.
<p><a href="https://github.com/OmniLayer/OmniJ" target="_blank">OmniJ</a> is a Java/JVM implementation of the <a href="http://www.omnilayer.org" target="_blank">Omni Layer</a>, an open-source, fully decentralized asset creation platform built on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>

<p>The OmniJ project was initially created for writing <a href="http://spockframework.org" target="_blank">Spock</a>
tests of <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#bitcoin-core-apis" target="_blank">Bitcoin RPC</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/blob/omnicore-0.0.10/doc/apidocumentation.md" target="_blank">Omni Core RPC</a>
(formerly Master Core) functions. This means the initial focus was on RPC clients, command-line (CLI) tools, and integration tests.</p>

<p>OmniJ currently consists of three subprojects/JARs, each of which includes unit and integration tests:</p>

<p>omnij-core</p>
<ul>
    <li>Classes defining abstractions from the Omni Protocol Specification</li>
    <li><code>OmniTxBuilder</code> and supporting classes to create and sign Omni Protocol transactions</li>
</ul>

<p>bitcoin-rpc</p>
<ul>
    <li>A client library for talking to bitcoind via JSON-RPC</li>
    <li>A library for writing command-line tools that talk to bitcoind via JSON-RPC</li>
    <li>Some sample command-line tools</li>
    <li>Integration tests (Spock Specs) and test support classes for testing Bitcoin Core RPCs</li>
</ul>

<p>omnij-rpc</p>
<ul>
    <li>Omni Protocol extensions to the JSON-RPC client for Omni Core</li>
    <li>Omni Protocol-specific command-line tools</li>
    <li>Classes for fetching, parsing, and comparing Omni Protocol consensus information</li>
    <li>Integration tests (Spock Specs) and test support classes for testing Omni Core RPCs</li>
</ul>
