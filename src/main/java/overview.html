The bitcoin-spock project was created for writing <a href="http://spockframework.org" target="_blank">Spock</a>
tests of <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#bitcoin-core-apis" target="_blank">Bitcoin RPC</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/mastercoin-MSC/mastercore/blob/mscore-0.0.9/doc/apidocumentation.md" target="_blank">Omni Core RPC</a>
(formerly Master Core) functions. In addition to the Spock specifications there is a collection
of test support classes written in Java and Groovy.

We are in the process of breaking out these support classes into their own subprojects and JAR files, as follows:
<br>
<br>
bitcoin-rpc:
<ul>
    <li>A client library for talking to bitcoind via JSON-RPC</li>
    <li>A library for writing command-line tools that talk to bitcoind via JSON-RPC</li>
</ul>

omnij-rpc:
<ul>
    <li>Omni Protocol extensions to the JSON-RPC client for Omni Core</li>
    <li>Omni Protocol-specific command-line tools</li>
    <li>Classes for fetching, parsing, and comparing Omni Protocol consensus information</li>
</ul>

omnij-core:
<ul>
    <li>Classes defining abstractions from the Omni Protocol Specification</li>
</ul>
