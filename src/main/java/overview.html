The bitcoin-spock project was created for writing <a href="https://github.com/spockframework/spock" target="_blank">Spock</a>
tests of <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#bitcoin-core-apis" target="_blank">Bitcoin RPC</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/mastercoin-MSC/mastercore/blob/michael-0921/doc/apidocumentation.md" target="_blank">Mastercoin RPC</a>
functions. In addition to the Spock specifications there is a collection
of test support classes written in Java and Groovy.

Some of these support packages should probably be broken out in to separate projects, modules, and/or jars.
For the time being it is simplest to keep them all in one project/module/jar.

The functionality consists of:
<ul>
    <li>A client library for talking to bitcoind via JSON-RPC</li>
    <li>A library for writing command-line tools that talk to bitcoind via JSON-RPC</li>
    <li>Mastercoin extensions to the JSON-RPC client for Master Core</li>
    <li>Classes defining abstractions from the Master Protocol Specification</li>
    <li>Mastercoin-specific command-line tools</li>
    <li>Classes for fetching, parsing, and comparing Master Protocol consensus information</li>
</ul>
